# House prices dataset

This is an end to end project in an economy domain. A regression model has been trained in order to detect house prices base on features like area,	bedrooms,	bathrooms,	stories	,mainroad	,guestroom,	basement	,hotwaterheating,	airconditioning,	parking,	prefarea,	furnishingstatus.

# Problem Description

Many students, workers and even civil servant mostly face dificulties in the prices for renting or buying a house that can suit their need. as a result most people buy houses and later regret the expenditure because the money they spent on the house doesnt matches the quality of the house. At times even the seller often suffer high loss because the quality of the house is not equivalent to the token they recieve for the house.

# Solution approach

 A model has been developed to be able to predict the house prices based on the above listed features. this model is simple and accurate and has been trained with linear regression,lasso and ridge regression models and tested on a real world data set. graphs have also been plotted to ease visualisation of how each of this features correlate with price.
